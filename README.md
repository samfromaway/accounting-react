## What Does Preview Mean?

This is a preview app of a other repository. The other repository features a login page and some more functionalities.
Furthermore this is not a production ready application. Some of the issues and additional adds can be found down below.

## Some Todos

master currency editable
ENV Variables  
feedback if transaction added
master year?
max and min display size
Alert() in other element from Material UI
proptypes
export to pdf

## Work Todo Before Functional as a preview

Add your Firebase credentials in firebase.js
Change Routs to <PrivateRoute/>
Add a log out button and function
Change the table format to numeric in amount and ex rate

## Some Issues

material ui table date format when edit
if by coincidence the new and old currency exchange should be the exact same you can't update just the currence when editing via the table.

## Strict Mode Disabled

Because of the table by material UI strict mode had to be disabled because of an error.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
